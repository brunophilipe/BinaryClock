# Binary Clock

A binary clock made with [Quartz Composer](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/graphics-and-animation.html).  
To use it as a screen saver on Mac OS X, just put the file `BinaryClock.qtz` in `/System/Library/Screen Savers/` or in `~/Library/Screen Savers/`.  
After that, you can now select it in your System preferences in the pane `Desktop and Screen Savers`.
